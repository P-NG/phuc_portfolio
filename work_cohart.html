        <h1>COMMUNITY FOLDER OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>Cohart is a social media platform where creatives, professionals in the art industry, and art enthusiasts can connect and build genuine relationships by sharing their passion and love for art. Since there are many titles that users can
          occupy within the art space. The Community Folder feature allows the users to easily filter through different groups of their community in Cohart to find the contact they’re looking for quickly and easily.

      <div class="col-md-6 problems-container">
        <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
        <p>The lack of an option to filter through countless connections besides the search filter requires memorizing specific names. It is difficult for any user to refine their search to a specific name when the average social media account
          follows more than 100 profiles. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 problems-container">
        <h2>SOLUTIONS</h2>
        <p>Utilizing a foldering system for categorizing connections by their titles such as artists, curators, etc. help user filter through countless contacts.

      <div class="col-md-6 problems-container">
        <h2>UX CHALLENGES</h2>
        <p>The Community page already has a UI system, so as the sole designer of the community folder I had to develop a UX flow that supplements the UI within the overall flow of the product. Additionally, I had to develop an editing system for the
          Community since it was not yet designed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 problems-container">
        <h2>GOALS</h2>
        <p>This feature aims to reduce the pain point of looking through an endless number of contacts so the user can quickly access different profiles. As a result, allowing for a more seamless flow that encourages interactions. </p>

        <h2>UNDERSTANDING</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Upon interviews with our early adopters, we received many feedbacks that helped us understand that many creatives on the internet today find it difficult to build genuine relationships with other creatives on
          other platforms. As a result, the focus of Cohart is to simplify and streamline the interaction process between users that encourage one on one and group conversations. </p>

        <h2>ONBOARDING PROCESS OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Since Cohart beta is still in the development stages, the onboarding process have under gone many revisions to be the most streamline process. A successful onboarding of any product requires the least amount of effort while obtaining the most crucial information from the user. So as the sole UX/UI Designer of the revised onboarding process, I did reimagined the process to be captivating for the users while acquiring information that is vital to building a user profile and populating the Discovery Feed.</p>

        <p>The previous onboarding had an overwhelming number of information input and surveys that prolong the time until the user gets to the actual product.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 problems-container">
        <h2>GOALS</h2>
        <p>To mitigate the extended onboarding process, secondary information were relocated to the profile page where the user can be more in-depth with their profile. Leaving only information that is crucial to build a user profile and help customize the user’s feed for the Discovery Page.
